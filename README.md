## Introduction

This project is a compilation of [Cornerstone](https://theme.co/cornerstone/) elements I have written for various purposes.

## Elements in this Set

### Icon Box

*Description*: A box that has an icon on the side.

* Need to make this more user-friendly!

### Image Box

*Description*: Aesthetically identical to the icon box, but takes images (ie SVGs) instead of the fontawesome library.

* This should be bundled in with the icon box, ideally.

### Header & Subheader

*Description*: An element that allows the display of a main header and subheader next to each other.

* I don't know why, but the CSS isn't sticking outside of my test environment. Something to look into later...

## To-Do List

* Provide instructions on how to make this set more modular.
* Write a basic tutorial on how to make your own elements
* Better descriptions for the elements included in this set
